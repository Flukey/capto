# capto

#### Development email testing made easy

Capto runs a simple SMTP server that captures any message sent to it, persists it into a mongodb collection and displays it in a web interface. No messages are relayed to any email addresses. The backend is written in NodeJs using the Express framework and the frontend is driven by ExtJs 5.
